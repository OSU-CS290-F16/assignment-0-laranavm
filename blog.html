		<li> <em>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</em> I already knew how to get simple text to show up, but what I learned right away just from reading the hw assignment was the built in LIST structure that makes a list with bullets. </li>
		<br><br>

		<li> <em>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</em> A small challenge for this assignment was remembering the tag for using an image, I simply had to look back to how exactly type it. </li>
		<br><br>

		<li> <em>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources? </em> I used Piazza as a sort of code-check to make sure I was using the most effecient methods. </li>
